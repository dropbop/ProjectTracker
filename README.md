# ProjectTracker
This is a Flask + HTML + CSS CRUD app for project tracking. It writes to a json "database" and is meant to be run 100% locally.

You can use it by downloading and writing a batch file along the lines of 
```
cd "C:\Users\you\whatever\project_tracker"
set FLASK_SECRET_KEY=whatever
"C\Users\you\whatever\python.exe" app.py
pause
```
